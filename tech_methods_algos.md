# Technical Methods and Algorithms

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the technical methods, algorithms, and architectural decisions used in building the video recommendation engine. We'll also explore alternative approaches and justify our choices.

## Core Algorithm: Semantic Similarity-Based Recommendations

### Our Chosen Approach: Sentence Transformers + Cosine Similarity

#### 1. Sentence Transformers for Semantic Embeddings

**What it is**: Sentence-Transformers is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text, and image embeddings. It's built on top of PyTorch and Transformers.

**How it works**:
- Takes text input (video title, description, tags, transcript)
- Processes it through a pre-trained transformer model
- Outputs a dense vector (embedding) that captures semantic meaning
- Similar content produces similar vectors in high-dimensional space

**Model Used**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Dimensions**: 384
- **Performance**: Good balance between quality and speed
- **Size**: ~23MB (lightweight for deployment)
- **Languages**: Supports 100+ languages
- **Training**: Trained on 1+ billion sentence pairs

**Why we chose this**:
- Pre-trained on massive datasets, no need for custom training
- Excellent semantic understanding capabilities
- Fast inference time suitable for real-time applications
- Proven performance on semantic similarity tasks
- Lightweight enough for production deployment

#### 2. Cosine Similarity for Vector Comparison

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
cosine_similarity(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
```

Where:
- A and B are embedding vectors
- A · B is the dot product
- ||A|| and ||B|| are the magnitudes (norms) of the vectors

**Properties**:
- Range: [-1, 1]
- 1 = identical vectors (perfect similarity)
- 0 = orthogonal vectors (no similarity)
- -1 = opposite vectors (completely dissimilar)

**Why cosine similarity**:
- Measures angle between vectors, not magnitude
- Robust to vector length differences
- Computationally efficient
- Well-suited for high-dimensional embeddings
- Standard metric for semantic similarity tasks

### Implementation Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   ```
   Video Content → Text Combination → Cleaning → Normalization
   ```

2. **Embedding Generation**:
   ```
   Combined Text → Sentence Transformer → 384-dim Vector
   ```

3. **Similarity Calculation**:
   ```
   Target Vector + All Vectors → Cosine Similarity → Ranked Results
   ```

4. **Recommendation Serving**:
   ```
   User Request → Load Embeddings → Calculate Similarities → Return Top-K
   ```

## Alternative Approaches and Comparisons

### 1. Collaborative Filtering

**What it is**: Recommends items based on user behavior patterns and similarities between users.

**Types**:
- **User-based**: Find similar users, recommend what they liked
- **Item-based**: Find similar items to what user has interacted with
- **Matrix Factorization**: Decompose user-item interaction matrix

**Pros**:
- Doesn't require content analysis
- Can discover unexpected connections
- Proven effective in many domains

**Cons**:
- Cold start problem for new users/items
- Requires substantial interaction data
- Sparsity issues with limited data
- Privacy concerns with user data

**Why we didn't choose it**: The assignment emphasizes content-based recommendations and semantic understanding. Collaborative filtering would require extensive user interaction data that may not be available.

### 2. Deep Learning Approaches

#### Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)

**What it is**: Uses neural networks to model user-item interactions.

**Architecture**:
- Embedding layers for users and items
- Multiple hidden layers with non-linear activations
- Output layer predicting interaction probability

**Pros**:
- Can capture complex non-linear relationships
- Flexible architecture
- Can incorporate additional features

**Cons**:
- Requires large amounts of training data
- Computationally expensive to train
- Black box (less interpretable)
- Overfitting risks with limited data

#### Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

**What it is**: Models relationships between users, videos, and categories as a graph structure.

**How it works**:
- Nodes represent users, videos, categories
- Edges represent interactions or relationships
- Message passing between connected nodes
- Learn embeddings that capture graph structure

**Pros**:
- Can model complex relationships
- Incorporates network effects
- Handles heterogeneous data well

**Cons**:
- Complex to implement and tune
- Requires substantial computational resources
- Needs careful graph construction
- May be overkill for content-based recommendations

**Why we didn't choose it**: While powerful, GNNs add significant complexity without clear benefits for our content-focused use case. The assignment can be effectively solved with simpler, more interpretable methods.

### 3. Traditional Content-Based Filtering

#### TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity

**What it is**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency with cosine similarity.

**How it works**:
- Convert text to TF-IDF vectors
- Each dimension represents a word's importance
- Calculate cosine similarity between vectors

**Pros**:
- Simple and interpretable
- Fast computation
- No training required
- Works well with keyword-rich content

**Cons**:
- Bag-of-words approach loses semantic meaning
- Struggles with synonyms and context
- High dimensionality with large vocabularies
- Poor handling of short texts

**Why we chose Sentence Transformers instead**: Modern transformer-based embeddings capture semantic meaning that TF-IDF misses. For example, "automobile" and "car" would be treated as completely different terms in TF-IDF but would have similar embeddings in our approach.

#### Word2Vec/Doc2Vec

**What it is**: Neural word embeddings that capture semantic relationships.

**How it works**:
- Train neural networks on large text corpora
- Learn dense vector representations for words/documents
- Similar words/documents have similar vectors

**Pros**:
- Captures semantic relationships
- Dense representations
- Can handle synonyms and context

**Cons**:
- Requires training on domain-specific data
- Fixed vocabulary limitations
- Averaging word vectors may lose sentence-level meaning
- Older technology compared to transformers

**Why Sentence Transformers are better**: Pre-trained on massive datasets, better sentence-level understanding, and state-of-the-art performance on semantic similarity tasks.

## Architecture Design Decisions

### 1. Pre-computation Strategy

**Decision**: Pre-compute all video embeddings and store them in a pickle file.

**Rationale**:
- Embedding generation is computationally expensive
- API responses need to be fast (< 200ms)
- Video content doesn't change frequently
- Trade storage space for response time

**Alternative**: Compute embeddings on-demand
- **Pros**: Lower storage requirements, always up-to-date
- **Cons**: Slow API responses, higher computational load

### 2. FastAPI Framework Choice

**Decision**: Use FastAPI instead of Flask or Django.

**Rationale**:
- High performance (comparable to Node.js and Go)
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Built-in data validation with Pydantic
- Async support for external API calls
- Type hints for better code quality

**Alternatives**:
- **Flask**: Simpler but lacks built-in features
- **Django**: Too heavy for API-only applications
- **Express.js**: Would require JavaScript/TypeScript

### 3. Embedding Storage Format

**Decision**: Use pickle files for embedding storage.

**Rationale**:
- Preserves exact NumPy array format
- Fast loading and saving
- Compact binary format
- Native Python support

**Alternatives**:
- **JSON**: Human-readable but larger file size and precision loss
- **HDF5**: Good for large datasets but adds dependency
- **Database**: More complex setup, unnecessary for read-only embeddings

### 4. Similarity Metric Choice

**Decision**: Cosine similarity over other distance metrics.

**Rationale**:
- Standard for semantic similarity tasks
- Normalized measure (independent of vector magnitude)
- Computationally efficient
- Well-understood and interpretable

**Alternatives**:
- **Euclidean Distance**: Sensitive to vector magnitude
- **Manhattan Distance**: Less suitable for high-dimensional data
- **Jaccard Similarity**: Better for binary/categorical data

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture Limitations

1. **Memory Usage**: All embeddings loaded into memory
2. **Single Instance**: No horizontal scaling support
3. **Synchronous Processing**: Blocking operations for large datasets

### Scaling Solutions

1. **Vector Databases**: Use Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant for large-scale vector storage and search
2. **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis for frequently accessed recommendations
3. **Microservices**: Separate embedding generation from recommendation serving
4. **Load Balancing**: Multiple API instances behind a load balancer
5. **Async Processing**: Use Celery for background embedding generation

## Performance Metrics

### Computational Complexity

- **Embedding Generation**: O(n) where n is text length
- **Similarity Calculation**: O(k) where k is number of videos
- **Top-K Selection**: O(k log k) for sorting
- **Overall**: O(n + k log k) per recommendation request

### Memory Requirements

- **Model Loading**: ~100MB for sentence transformer model
- **Embeddings Storage**: ~1.5KB per video (384 dimensions × 4 bytes)
- **For 10,000 videos**: ~15MB embedding storage

### Response Time Targets

- **Health Check**: < 10ms
- **Recommendations**: < 200ms
- **Similar Videos**: < 100ms
